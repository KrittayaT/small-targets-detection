# small-targets-detection

The small targets will be measured using the [COCO evaluation](https://cocodataset.org/#detection-eval) method. However, this project will focus on small targets as drones.

This project will use 2 different methods to detect small targets

1) DroneDetectron2 refers to this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08747) and this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/akhilpm/DroneDetectron2) for more information.
